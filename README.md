# BIXI
BIXI is a bike share program (Similair to Hopr, Carrem bike, Lime). They have a public dataset available for free. I used data of their ridership from 2016-2017
I used MySQL to determine the average ridership, popularity of stations, etc. and used Tableau Software and google sheets to create visualizations

## Annual Report BIXI 2017
This is a simulated report of the performance of the BIXI. Here I used a combination of MySQL queries and google sheets graphs to create it. 

## BIXI Deliverable Pt. 2
Here, I linked my SQL database to the tableau program and created visualizations within it. Everything from location popularity to ridership througout the year.

## BIXI part 2 Submission
Here I linked the visualizations used in tableau. You will need the tableau software to open it, and my free trial has already expiered. You can buy it yourself but its 70 bucks US so you can stick to the docs. 

## BIXI project Deliverable Results in Excel Form
Here are the tables that I used in the doc. My computer is not too powerful so I had to store them outside so that I could get the queries to run faster instead of letting them stay in their regular tabs. 

## BIXI project delierable SQL code
Here are all teh SQL queries I used to get various results.
